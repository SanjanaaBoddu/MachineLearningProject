Consumer complaints are an integral part of various industries, providing valuable insights into customer experiences. Efficient resolution of these complaints is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction. In this project, we explore the application of machine learning techniques to predict and understand patterns related to consumer dispute resolutions. 
The project begins by analyzing a dataset of consumer complaints, encompassing diverse products and issues. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to uncover trends, distribution of complaints, and key factors influencing consumer disputes. 
Feature engineering is a crucial step where temporal aspects such as the duration of complaints and the day of the week are extracted. Categorical variables are encoded, and missing values are handled appropriately. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development. 
A variety of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost, are implemented to predict whether a consumer is likely to dispute the resolution of their complaint. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and the best-performing model is selected. 
The project concludes with the deployment of the chosen model to predict consumer disputes in a test dataset. The model's predictions are analyzed, and the final consumer dispute column is populated accordingly. 
This project aims to provide a predictive framework for companies to anticipate and address potential consumer disputes, contributing to improved customer service and satisfaction.
